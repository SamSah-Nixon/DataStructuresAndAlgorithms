Extra Discussion

1. O(n log(n)) and O(n^2) both increase at different exponentional values and O(n^2) increases faster than O(n log(n)).
The intersecting part where both methods have the same time complexity is when n = 100.

2. There are n friends and the maximum allowed for each friend is i times. 
For every friend to reach the maximum the total visits (C) would equal i*n.
But we only want to know when the first friend reaches the max.
For every friend to be right before the maximum allowed visits C would equal n*(i-1)
For one friend to have the max C would equal n*(i-1)+1
C = n*(i-1)+1
